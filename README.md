Investing in Waves and Ice Cream!

## Objective 
After a lovely vacation in Hawaii, I came up with a business plan to open a Surf n' Shake shop in Oahu.  A potential investor wanted an analysis of the weather in the area.  
    ### Original Analysis: 
        - Retrieve the Precipitation Data
        - Find the Number of Stations
        - Determine the Most Active Stations
        - Find Low, High, and Average Temperatures
        - Build Flask Routes

After presenting my original analysis, the investor requested an analysis of the temperature data for June and December. The is to determine if the business will be sustainable year-round.
    ### Additonal Analysis:
        - Summary Statistics for June
        - Summary Statistics for December
